Later on, I created a function with `async await` to handle the accessibility the data from the server and turn it into object. - I created a displayMovies function to create an html and store the data from the server into that html and show it into the list. After that I activated the displayMovies function by matching it to the information I fetched from the server. - I append the html into the big one, in order to show it to my list.",
